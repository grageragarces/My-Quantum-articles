### Welcome!
Welcome to Schrödinger's Papers #1 Issue! Through this project, I hope to help communicate the research behind existing quantum technology papers and thus help promote a scientifically oriented and accurate understanding of quantum technologies for all audiences. As a student in the Quantum field, I come through dozens of papers every week and have acquired the ability to extract the main arguments and points from such publications. Hopefully, this skill will shine through these issues and help others acquire the ability to understand deeply technical publications and apply their conclusions to practical and proof-oriented investments, research, and actions within their organizations or studies.
Before we start I would like to have two short disclaimers:
1.	I will always try my best to express the author(s)’s main arguments and logic with accuracy, nevertheless, due to the nature of certain papers and my background, I might sometimes misinterpret or paraphrase the contents of a paper, which might have specific consequences on it’s presented arguments. I will do my best to avoid these instances, but if they were ever to happen, please feel free to reach out to me as I will be happy to revise my content.
2.	I will always attach a link to discussed papers at the end of these issues, so you can always directly read the original publication and draw your own conclusions.
Now let’s begin!
